# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

# About the Project
This project aims to predict breast cancer using ensemble learning methods. It leverages the power of combining multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. The ensemble methods implemented include Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

# Model Overview
Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate and robust prediction. In this project, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting are used for breast cancer prediction. For more details on ensemble methods, refer to scikit-learn documentation.
